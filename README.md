# Virtual_Art_Gallery
This project is a single-page Virtual Art Gallery designed entirely using fundamental HTML elements, strictly adhering to the assignment's constraint of using only HTML structure.

It showcases how layout, navigation, and basic content organization can be achieved using only the structure provided by standard HTML tags.

Features
1.Classic Layout: Uses the center tag and table elements (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`) to manage page alignment and structure, mimicking early web design techniques.

2.Hierarchical Content: Utilizes the header tags (`<h1>` through `<h4>`) to establish a clear content hierarchy for titles and sections.

3.Visual Separation: Employs the horizontal rule (`<hr>`) and line breaks (`<br>`) for visual spacing and clear section separation.

4.Navigation: Features both internal (within the page) and external navigation links using anchor tags (`<a>`).

5.Image Display: Incorporates artwork into the gallery view using the image tag (`<img>`).

How to Run
Since this project contains only structural markup, running it is simple:

Locate the main HTML file, art_gallery.html.

Double-click the file to open it directly in any web browser.

Technology Used
This project was developed under the strict condition of using only basic, structural HTML tags. The following elements were used to build the gallery:

1.Layout Elements: The tags `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` were used for organizing content into a grid or column layout.

2.Heading Elements: The tags `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and `<h4>` were used to define page titles and section headers.

3.Spacing and Alignment Elements: The tags `<hr>`, `<br>`, and `<center>` were used to create dividing lines, line breaks, and central alignment for the content.

4.Media and Interactivity Elements: The tags `<img>` and `<a>` were used to display images and provide hyperlinking for navigation.
